The Wildspaces concept is an idea created by the Denver DevOps Meetup.  

It is an informal - and unorganized - gathering of Devops and SRE Professionals who go out into nature together and work.  The event is inspired by our mutual love for nature and the devopsdays conference, borrowing the [Openspace Concept.](https://devopsdays.org/open-space-format/)  

Throughout the event, we will work our normal workday, often creating ad-hoc groups to eat, talk, hike, mountain bike, stargaze or sit around the campfire.  At the end of the day, we run Openspaces and are toying with the idea of [Ignite talks.](https://devopsdays.org/ignite-talks-format/) 


The general code of conduct is to be respectful, open minded, and considerate of your neighbors and nature.  Because a big aspect of the event is coming together for our shared appreciation for nature, it is a core principle of the event to leave nature better than we found it.  This means abiding by the [leave no trace principles.](https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/)
