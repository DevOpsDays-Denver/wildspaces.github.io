The Wildspaces concept is an idea created by members of the the Denver DevOps Meetup as a way to engage with the DevOps community the best way we know how - in the mountain wilderness of Colorado.

It is a gathering of Devops and SRE Professionals who go out into nature together and work.  The event is inspired by our mutual love for nature and the devopsdays conference, borrowing the [Openspace Concept.](https://devopsdays.org/open-space-format/)

Throughout the event, we will work our normal workday, while creating ad-hoc groups to eat, talk, hike, mountain bike, stargaze or sit around the campfire.

This means abiding by the [leave no trace principles.](https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/)
