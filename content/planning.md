Though we often share things with one another, the first principle is that you must be self-sufficient.  

Everything starts with bringing enough water.  If you don't know how much water you need, start with 2 gallons per person per day.  

You know your body best, bring as much food as you would normally eat.  If you are going to participate in something physical, like a hike, bring additional food, and snacks to bring along to keep offset the additional activity.

Bring everything you need to survive your workday. This probably starts with a laptop, a chair, headphones (a must if you have meetings).  Some people bring desks, keyboards, and secondary monitors.  Whatever you bring, you must be able to power it all throughout the event.  Power is not provided.  Most of us use a portable power pack combined with solar panels.

For camping, REI provides an [camping checklist](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/family-camping-checklist.html) that is a great place to start.  Consider the weather, and bring the right amount of blankets, warmth, and proper clothing.
